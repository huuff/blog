### Kotlin vs Java
* Note on how DSLs are much more comfortable in Kotlin, especially about how implicit receivers introduce grammars. I've uploaded a screenshot with an example of a Java DSL that sucks. This is especially bad when `get` is a static method of the DSL... since all of them have it and there are just like a thousand import options.
